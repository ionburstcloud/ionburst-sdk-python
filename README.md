## Getting Started

### Installation

```sh
pip3 install ionburst-sdk-python
```

### Configuration

The Ionburst SDK can get its configuration (ionburst_id, ionburst_key, ionburst_uri) from the following three files.

If `ionburst_id` and `ionburst_key` are not specified by environment variable, they are obbtained from the credentials file with information from the `config.json` file.

If `ionburst_uri` is not specified in Ionburst constructor, it'll first check `config.json`, and then the credentials file.

#### Environment Variables

```sh
IONBURST_ID=IB******************
IONBURST_KEY=eW91aGF2ZXRvb211Y2h0aW1lb255b3VyaGFuZHMh
```

#### config.json file

```json
{
  "Ionburst": {
    "Profile": "test",
    "IonBurstUri": "https://api.example.ionburst.io/",
    "TraceCredentialsFile": "OFF",
  }
}
```

#### Credentials file

```sh
[example]
ionburst_id=IB******************
ionburst_key=eW91aGF2ZXRvb211Y2h0aW1lb255b3VyaGFuZHMh
ionburst_uri=https://api.example.ionburst.io/
```

### Usage

#### Initialise

```sh
from Ionburst import Ionburst
ionburst = Ionburst()

```

or

```sh
from Ionburst import Ionburst
ionburst = Ionburst("https://api.example.ionburst.io/")
```

#### Upload Data

```sh
result = ionburst.put({
  id: '...',
  data: '...',
  classstr: '...' // Not Required
})
```

#### Download Data

```sh
result = ionburst.get(id)
```

#### Delete Data

```sh
result = ionburst.delete(id)
```

#### Upload Data Deferred

```sh
token = ionburst.startDeferredAction({
  action: 'PUT',
  id: '...',
  data: '...',
  classstr: '...'  // Not Required
})
```

#### Download Data Deferred

```sh
token = ionburst.startDeferredAction({
  action: 'GET',
  id: '...'
})
```

#### Check Data Deferred

```sh
result = ionburst.checkDeferred(token)
```

#### Fetch Data Deferred

```sh
result = ionburst.fetch(token)
```

#### Get Classifcations

```sh
data = ionburst.getClassifications()
```
